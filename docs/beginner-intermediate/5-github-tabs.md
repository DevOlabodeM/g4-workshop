![Tabs](./vscode-pack/tabs.png)

1.  Code Tabs (Mark Red)

-   Issues
>    GitHub Issues are use to track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.

    This gives access to discussion and interactions. When a conversation in an issue is better suited for a discussion, you can convert the issue to a discussion.

-   Pull Request

>   This works better with branches. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository. You can then work on this new branch in isolation from changes that other people are making to the repository. A branch you create to build a feature is commonly referred to as a feature branch or topic branch

-   Actions

>   Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions. You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a completely customized workflow.

-   Code

> Take user back to the root directory.

2.  Profile Tab (Mark Blue)

-   User have access to view, edit and share their profile to the world.

3.  Reaction Tabs (Mark Yellow)

-   This is where you reacts and set notifications on a particular repository.

>   -   star tab gives ability to give the repo more credibility and visibilities.
>   -   fork tab gives ability to a remote copy of a public repo which other created. 

1.  Action Tabs (Mark Pink)

-   This gives user ability to add, edit and commit files, images and folders.

>   -   Code gives user access to copy https, ssh links and even url to connect to GH CLI
